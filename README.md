# No_More_SQL

Information is very vital in the 21st century. This information is widely stored in databases. To retrieve data/information from databases we need to master a Database Language/Schema which can be a tedious task for people who know little or no programming. To tackle this problem, we propose to use natural language (English) to retrieve information from the databases. Firstly, we process the natural language question and extract the vital information from it using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, stop words removal, lemmatization, etc. We have incorporated the use of previously available dataset WIKISQL. 
NLIDB provides the user an interface in which the user can formally type the required query in the form of an English statement. NLIDB performs the task of extracting the information from the Database as well as displaying the result in the form of a natural language. Also, for the visualization part, we have proposed to implement data analytics techniques to represent the data in the form of graphs. There can be trends, patterns and useful information hidden within the data which will be of no use if it is not analyzed. This information can then be used to optimize processes to increase the overall efficiency of a business or system.
